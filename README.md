Our ideas:

##Stock Keeping

Our team is busy with making a project in which company's can use a blockchain to keep there stocks (voorraad).

Other company's can then show there stock to eachother and others can see their stock.
Also whole sellers can view the stock of there customers and advise selling certain products.


The assets:
We are using assets to be able to show the products and find the amounts that a certain company has of a certain product.

The streams:
We are using streams to dump data of the certain products into a stream.
